I successfully completed the hands-on workshop 'From Prompt Chains to Pipelines: Building AI Agent Workflows with Gemini, LangChain, and LangGraph.' This immersive session, led by Google’s Developer Relations team, provided a deep dive into the evolution of AI agents, progressing from simple zero-shot prompting with the Gemini API to more complex workflows using LangChain and, ultimately, autonomous AI agents built with LangGraph.

Through practical coding exercises, I gained hands-on experience with Python, Google's Gemini API, and leading open-source frameworks. I explored techniques to enhance AI capabilities, streamline automation, and apply these powerful tools to real-world engineering challenges.

This workshop reinforced my understanding of LLMs, AI agent architectures, and prompt engineering, equipping me with the skills to build more sophisticated AI-driven applications using the best of open-source tools and Google’s cutting-edge AI technology.
